/*
Time

These tokens define timing for CSS transitions or
animations. As a rule of thumb, UI elements which are
small in size can have faster animations than large
lements.

Hence the postfix "-small": We use these tokens below
mostly for subtle hover effects on small components like
buttons. We are are going to add more for large components
as we build them.
